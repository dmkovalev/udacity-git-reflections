What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git with metafiles is created. Unless you do that there is no information about repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is a working place for repository - it contains just things we want to commit, possible not all files. It helps make logical closed changes aas commits and focus just on them.
