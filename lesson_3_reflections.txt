1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To share your work, to work with others, to keep remote copies. Always!

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to keep experimental features not on the production remote copy, some commits should be done together to remote to create some features, 


3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
